## The Problem
After reading an incredibly insightful [article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/06/the-making-of-in-pieces/) on the process behind the making of [In Pieces](http://species-in-pieces.com/) I decided to try and improve upon the process slightly by creating a web application for the dynamic creation of svg graphics within the browser.

## Dependencies
The application uses Ruby on Rails for its basic CRUD system, postgreSQL for the database and is also hosted on Heroku. Aside from this, jQuery was used to facilitate easier access to DOM elements and SnapJS was employed to allow for easier manipulation, creation and storage of SVG elements created by the application. 

## Improvements
The application currently only allows for the manipulation and creation of SVGs. In the future there should be an option to allow users to:
* generate pieces using clip paths. 
* undo and redo any changes made to an object 
* export completed works as SVGs or raster images.

## Technologies Used: 
* Javascript
* jQuery
* underscore
* HTML
* SCSS
* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
